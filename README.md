On average runners need to change their shoes every 500-700km. And since I've picked up running like last week because of the quarantine, and bought a pair of Nikes, I will decide to save up for the next pair of shoes starting from now.

Idea:

- Shoes cost around 110 euros
- They need to be changed every 600km 
- I track all my running on Starva
- I do all my banking on bunq
- Every kilometer I run my bunq pays 0.18 cents (110/600) to my "Running shoes" account
