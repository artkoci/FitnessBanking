## Introduction
On average runners need to change their shoes every 500-700km. Since I've picked up running during the quarantine, I decided to save up for my next pair of shoes whilst I run.

### Idea:

- Shoes cost around 110 euros
- They need to be changed every 600km 
- I track all my running on Starva
- I do all my banking on bunq
- Every kilometer I run my bunq pays 0.18 cents (110/600) to my "Run fatboy run" account

### What do you need:

- bunq account 🌈
- Strava account 🏃‍
- API access for both accounts. For more follow:

  - Strava: https://developers.strava.com/
- And start running
